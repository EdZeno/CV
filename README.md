I consider conciseness to be a virtue and I am often guilty of oversimplifying complex issues so I will try to keep this CV as short as possible.  My diverse experience led me to tech after I have realized that it has the awesome capability to create immense real value and tangible benefits from a minimal investment of commodities. Code is cheap it can be written and rewritten without any cost other than time. I am as any other person is much more than what I do or have done for living, but to demonstrate a few of my skills and because you are reading a CV after all I will describe my work experience below.     

Skills
I am eager to learn
As the education section of this CV shows I am committed to constant self-improvement and development, thus I have managed to graduate with two master degrees and finish an intense coding bootcamp. 

I think I am good with people.
While working in debt collection I have encountered and dealt with an immense number of emotionally highly charged situations and learned effective methods of conflict resolution, but most importantly I have learned how to be patient with people.
